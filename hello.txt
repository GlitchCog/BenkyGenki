Matt (and Whit)!

It's Frank (and Darci) - we need to reconnect!! It's been a long time and we miss you guys. I'm not sure what happened over time but we're interested in what's going on in your lives. 

Somehow I've lost all your contact info and this was the only (easy) way I've found to message you - wasn't able to find you on facebook or anything else.

My gmail is ftank99@gmail.com, phone 267-304-8317. Send me an email sometime to rekindle. 

Life is too short to loose touch with good friends.

Regards,
  Frank Arsenault
